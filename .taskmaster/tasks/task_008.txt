# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Mock Data State Management
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 5, 6, 7
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up a state management system for handling mock data and CRUD operations.
# Details:
Use React Context API for global state management. Create separate contexts for leads, calls, emails, and evaluations. Implement reducer functions for CRUD operations. Use TypeScript for type safety. Optimize performance with useMemo and useCallback hooks.

# Test Strategy:
Write unit tests for reducer functions. Test state updates for all CRUD operations. Verify context provider wrapping and proper state distribution.
