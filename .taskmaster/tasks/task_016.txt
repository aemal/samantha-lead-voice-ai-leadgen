# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize a Supabase project and configure the PostgreSQL database schema as the starting point for the database migration phase.
# Details:
Create a new Supabase project to begin the database migration phase. Set up database tables for leads, phone_calls, lead_emails, lead_evaluations, lead_comments, and user_profiles as per the PRD schema. Configure proper indexes and foreign key relationships. Set up row-level security policies. This task marks the transition from frontend mock data to persistent database storage.

# Test Strategy:
