Format the README with clear headings, code blocks with syntax highlighting, and step-by-step instructions that are easy to follow. Include links to official Supabase documentation where appropriate.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify README completeness:
   - Ensure all required sections are included and properly formatted
   - Check that all code examples are correct and properly syntax-highlighted
   - Verify that all commands and instructions are accurate

2. Test instructions by following them on a fresh setup:
   - Create a new local environment following only the README instructions
   - Set up environment variables as documented
   - Run migrations according to the instructions
   - Execute the seeding process as described
   - Verify RLS policies are correctly applied

3. Peer review:
   - Have another team member follow the instructions to verify clarity
   - Collect feedback on any confusing or incomplete sections
   - Update documentation based on feedback

4. Documentation validation:
   - Check for broken links or references
   - Ensure consistency with actual codebase structure and commands
   - Verify that screenshots or diagrams (if any) are current and accurate

5. Accessibility check:
   - Ensure the markdown is properly structured for screen readers
   - Check that code blocks are properly formatted for accessibility
   - Verify color contrast in any custom formatting
