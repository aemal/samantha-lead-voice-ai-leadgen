# Title: Migrate Mock Data to Supabase
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 16
# Priority: medium
# Description: Transfer mock data from JSON to the Supabase PostgreSQL database.
# Details:
Create a data migration script using Node.js and the Supabase JavaScript client. Ensure data integrity during migration. Handle potential conflicts or duplicates. Add proper error handling and logging. Create a rollback mechanism in case of migration failure.

# Test Strategy:
Verify successful data migration for all entities. Check data integrity and relationships post-migration. Test rollback functionality. Ensure no data loss or corruption during the process.
